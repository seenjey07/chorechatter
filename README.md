# ChoreChatter

ChoreChatter is a simple and interactive chat and to-do application designed to help users manage their daily tasks in a fun and engaging way. The app combines a mock chatbot feature with a to-do list to create a lightweight productivity tool.

## Features

### Chatbox with Mock AI Integration

- Users can type messages into the chatbox, and the mock AI will respond with predefined replies.
- If the user includes keywords such as **"add task"** or **"new task"** in their message, the mock AI will automatically extract the task from the message and add it to the to-do list.
  - For example:
    - User: _"Add task: Buy groceries"_
    - Mock AI: _"Got it! Iâ€™ve added 'Buy groceries' to your to-do list."_

### To-Do List Management

- Users can manually add tasks to the to-do list using the input field in the to-do area.
- Tasks are displayed on the right side of the screen for easy access.

### Clean and Simple UI

- The app features a visually appealing and minimalist design with:
  - A chat area labeled **"Let's Chat!"** for user-Mock AI interaction.
  - A to-do area where users can view, add, and manage tasks.
- Light and playful color scheme to make task management less stressful.

## How It Works

1. **Chat Functionality**: Users can interact with the mock chatbot by typing messages in the chatbox.
2. **Task Detection**: When users mention adding tasks in the chat (using keywords), the mock AI detects the task and updates the to-do list automatically.
3. **Manual Input**: Users can add tasks manually by typing in the to-do input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Plain Vanilla CSS
- **Mock AI**: Predefined logic-based response system for recognizing keywords
- **Development Tools**: Vite for building the application
